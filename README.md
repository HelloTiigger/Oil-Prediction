# Oil-Prediction

We conducted three machine learning models using R, consisting of linear regression, CART (decision tree) and Random Forest to find key parameters influencing oil production and to predict oilwell production. 

We used models without 'year' colomn to identify important factors affecting crude oil production to prevent time trend influence of our dataset. And used models with 'year' to do the prediction.
